📊 Measuring the Pulse of Prosperity: An Index of Economic Freedom Analysis

🌐 Introduction

Economic freedom is the fundamental right of individuals to control their labor and property. In economically free societies, people are free to work, produce, consume, and invest however they choose, with minimal interference from government—only enough to protect and maintain liberty.

Historically, the lack of economic freedom kept billions in poverty and deprivation. Today, due to growing economic liberty, the world is seeing unprecedented prosperity. The Index of Economic Freedom, published by The Heritage Foundation, measures this progress annually.

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the 2022 Index of Economic Freedom, exploring global trends and drawing insights from the 12 core indicators categorized into four pillars:

Rule of Law (Property Rights, Government Integrity, Judicial Effectiveness)

Government Size (Spending, Tax Burden, Fiscal Health)

Regulatory Efficiency (Business Freedom, Labor Freedom, Monetary Freedom)

Open Markets (Trade, Investment, Financial Freedom)
